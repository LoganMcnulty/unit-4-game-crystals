- define variables
* will need a random integer between 1-50 for winningNumber, and for rupees random integer between 1-10 
    * create global variable winningNumber = 0
    * create global variable = blue/red/white/green rupee = 0
    * since these will be new numbers each game, they will be redefined within startGame() 
        * console.log(Math.round(Math.random() * 50))
        * console.log(Math.round(Math.random() * 10))
* global variable for wins/losses
